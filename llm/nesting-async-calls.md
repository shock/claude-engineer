It appears you're encountering an issue related to running asynchronous code within an already running event loop. This is a common problem when working with asyncio in Python, especially when nesting async calls. Let's break down the issue and suggest some solutions:

1. Error explanation:
   The main error is: `RuntimeError: asyncio.run() cannot be called from a running event loop`

   This occurs because you're trying to run an asyncio event loop inside another event loop. Specifically, the `prompt_toolkit` library is trying to start its own event loop within your main asyncio loop.

2. Identifying the problem:
   The issue is in the `get_prompt` function:

   ```python
   async def get_prompt():
       prompt = await session.prompt('> ', completer=main_completer)
       return prompt
   ```

   The `session.prompt()` method is likely trying to run its own event loop, which conflicts with the outer asyncio loop.

3. Potential solutions:

   a. Use a synchronous version of prompt_toolkit:
      If possible, you could use a synchronous version of prompt_toolkit instead of the async version. This would avoid the nested event loop issue.

   b. Use asyncio.to_thread():
      You can run the prompt in a separate thread to avoid blocking the main event loop:

   ```python
   import asyncio

   async def get_prompt():
       return await asyncio.to_thread(session.prompt, '> ', completer=main_completer)
   ```

   c. Use a different async-compatible input method:
      Consider using a different library or method for getting input that's fully compatible with asyncio.

4. Restructuring the code:
   If the above solutions don't work, you might need to restructure your code to avoid nesting async calls. One approach could be to separate the prompt handling from the main asyncio loop.

Here's a potential restructure of your main function:

```python
import asyncio
from prompt_toolkit import PromptSession

session = PromptSession()

def get_prompt_sync():
    return session.prompt('> ', completer=main_completer)

async def main():
    while True:
        try:
            user_input = await asyncio.to_thread(get_prompt_sync)
            print(f'You entered: {user_input}')
            # Process the user input here
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            break
        except EOFError:
            break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

This approach runs the prompt in a separate thread, allowing it to block without interfering with the main asyncio event loop.

Remember to test this solution thoroughly, as it may introduce new challenges related to thread safety and synchronization.

Would you like me to explain any part of this solution in more detail or suggest alternative approaches?

Among the solutions proposed, the most robust and conventional approach would be to use `asyncio.to_thread()`. Here's why:

1. Robustness:
   - It maintains the asynchronous nature of your application while solving the nested event loop problem.
   - It allows the prompt to block in its own thread without interfering with the main event loop.
   - It's less likely to cause unexpected behavior or race conditions compared to more complex restructuring.

2. Conventionality:
   - `asyncio.to_thread()` is a standard part of Python's asyncio library (introduced in Python 3.9).
   - It's specifically designed to run blocking operations in a separate thread within an asyncio context.
   - This approach follows the "asynchronous-first" design principle, which is becoming increasingly common in Python applications.

3. Simplicity:
   - It requires minimal changes to your existing code structure.
   - It's easy to understand and maintain.

4. Flexibility:
   - This solution allows you to keep using prompt_toolkit, which seems to be a key part of your application.

Here's how you would implement this solution:

```python
import asyncio
from prompt_toolkit import PromptSession

session = PromptSession()

async def get_prompt():
    return await asyncio.to_thread(session.prompt, '> ', completer=main_completer)

async def main():
    while True:
        try:
            user_input = await get_prompt()
            print(f'You entered: {user_input}')
            # Process the user input here
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            break
        except EOFError:
            break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

This solution:
- Keeps your main loop asynchronous
- Runs the blocking prompt operation in a separate thread
- Maintains the overall structure of your original code
- Is compatible with Python 3.9 and later versions

It's worth noting that while this is the most robust and conventional solution given the constraints of using prompt_toolkit and maintaining an async structure, the absolute most conventional approach for simpler command-line tools might be to use synchronous I/O. However, given the context of your application (with custom completers and potentially other async operations), the asyncio-based solution with `to_thread()` is indeed the best fit.
